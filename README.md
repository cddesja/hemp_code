# R Code for Handbook of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R

This repository contains all the `R` code contained in Desjardins & Bulut (2018)'s "Handbook of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R." The `R` code in this repository is separated by chapter. For example, `ch1.R` is the `R` code that corresponds to Chapter 1, `ch2.R` is the `R` code that corresponds to Chapter 2, and so on. 

All the `R` code may be downloaded by clicking `Clone or Download` and then clicking `Download Zip`. Alternatively, individual chapters can be downloaded separately by clicking on the name of the `R` script, then clicking the `Raw` button, and finally saving that page as a `.R` file.

__Note.__ This is not the repository for the `R` companion package `hemp`. That repository is located [here](https://github.com/cddesja/hemp).
